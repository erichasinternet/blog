# Travel eSims are Bad. I'm going to fix them.

I've always been frustrated with the state of international data plans. The endless cycle of buying new SIMs, dealing with expiring data, and managing multiple carriers across different countries felt like a problem that shouldn't exist in 2025. And I'm going to do something about it.

## The Problem: Death by a Thousand Cuts

### Data That Vanishes Into Thin Air

Picture this: You're planning a trip to Europe. You buy a 30-day data plan for €25, use maybe 2GB out of your 10GB allowance, and then watch helplessly as the remaining 8GB disappears when your plan expires. It's like buying a full tank of gas and having half of it evaporate after a month.

Providers have built their business models around this planned obsolescence of data, knowing that most travelers will never use their full allocation before expiration.

### The SIM Card Shuffle

Then there's the logistics nightmare. Different providers for different regions, each with their own app, account system, and payment method.

Every trip meant research: Which provider works best in this country? What's their coverage like? Do they have reasonable rates?

### The Subscription Trap

Many eSIM providers have moved to subscription models, which sounds convenient until you realize you're paying monthly fees for data you might use once or twice a year. Why should occasional travelers subsidize the infrastructure costs through recurring charges?

## The Vision: One eSIM to Rule Them All

I wanted to build something radically different – an eSIM that would work like data should work in 2025:

### Data That Never Expires

This was non-negotiable. Data is data. Whether you use it today or next year shouldn't matter. That €25 you spend actually gets you €25 worth of value, not €25 worth of time pressure.

### True Global Coverage

Instead of maintaining relationships with hundreds of carriers worldwide, we're partnered with tier-1 network operators who have roaming agreements already in place. This means one eSIM profile that works across 100+ countries without any configuration or carrier switching.

### No Surprise Bills

Subscription fatigue is real. Nobody wants another monthly charge for something they use sporadically. My new app works on a simple top-up model – pay for what you need, when you need it. No recurring fees, no surprise charges, no auto-renewals unless you explicitly want them.

## Building for the Modern Traveler

### The Technical Challenge

Creating a seamless eSIM experience isn't just about the network side – it's about the entire user journey. The app needed to handle everything from onboarding to real-time usage monitoring without the complexity that plagues most carrier apps.

We building a React Native app using Expo EAS, with a focus on simplicity and reliability. Real-time data usage tracking, instant plan activation, and a clean interface.

### Coverage That Actually Matters

Rather than claiming coverage in 200+ countries (many of which you'll never visit), we focused on the places people actually go. Our 100+ country coverage includes all major travel destinations with reliable, high-speed connections through premium network operators.

Each country shows you exactly which local networks you'll connect to – no more wondering if you'll get stuck on a slow 3G network because your eSIM provider went with the cheapest option.

## The Road Ahead

Stay tuned, I'm launching this month (June 2025) on iOS. I'll probably the the Android version ready next month.

## Why This Matters

In an increasingly connected world, access to reliable data shouldn't be a luxury or a logistical nightmare. Your data plan should work for you, not against you.


The old way of doing things made sense when international roaming was exotic and expensive. Today, it's just artificial friction in an increasingly borderless digital world. It was time for something better.
